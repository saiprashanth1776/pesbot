ï	The architecture course shall be of minimum duration of 5 academic years or 10 semesters of
approximately 16 working weeks each inclusive of six months/one semester of approximately 16 working weeks of practical training after the first stage in a professional office.
ï	The students shall undergo Practical Training in a recognized architectural firm which has COA registered architect, having experience of at
least 5 years.
ï	The completion of first stage shall not qualify candidates for registration under the Architects Act, 1972.
ï	For registration as an Architect, a candidate must successfully complete both stages.
ï	A candidate shall not be permitted to enroll for the Architectural Design course in a semester unless he/ she has completed the Architectural Design course of the previous semester.
ï	A candidate shall not be permitted to enroll for the tenth semester Architectural Design Thesis/ dissertation/project course unless he/ she has successfully completed Practical Training/ Internship.
ï	In case a candidate is not able to complete the program in the prescribed duration, the University/ Institution may provide an exit option for the candidate if he/ she has completed and earned all credits for the first three years of study.
Credit system
Semester-wise credit-based system is followed in each programme of study except in the case of very-short non-degree programmes. Generally credits shall be assigned to each course in a programme of study based on the following pattern:
ONE credit for ONE lecture (L) hour;
ONE credit for TWO tutorial (T) hours;
ONE credit for TWO laboratory/seminar (P) hours; ONE credit for FOUR self study (S) hours.
Each course shall be represented in the form of ëL-T-P-S-Cí where L, T, P, S and C mean respectively, the number of lecture hours per week, number of tutorial hours per week, number of practical hours per week, the number of self study hours per week and the number of credits assigned to the course. The credits assigned to each course shall be calculated as C = L + T/2 + P/2 + S/4.
For example, ë3-2-0-0-4í means three lecture hours and two tutorial hours amounting to a total of 4 credits.
The minimum number of credits required to be earned for a degree programme shall be calculated on the basis of TWENTY to TWENTY TWO credits per regular semester. For example,
ï	a 5-year degree programme shall comprise of ten regular semesters and therefore require a minimum of 22 x 10 = 220 credits (except BArch);
ï	a 4-year degree programme shall comprise of eight regular semesters and therefore require a minimum of 22 x 8 = 176 credits (BTech from 2018 batch onwards is 160 credits except BDes)
 
Academic Policies and Regulations	PES University
ï	a 3-year degree program shall comprise of six regular semesters and therefore require a minimum of 22 x 6 = 132 credits (MCA is 120 credits);
ï	a 2-year degree program shall comprise of four regular semesters and therefore require a minimum of 20 x 4 = 80 credits.
A full-time student shall normally register for TWENTY THREE credits in a regular semester and exceptional full-time student may be permitted to register for a maximum of TWENTY EIGHT credits during a regular semester.
Every course in a programme of study normally runs for the full length of a semester.

The University shall follow a letter grading system by allocating a letter grade for a band of marks appropriately for each course. The letter grades shall be awarded grade points, as per the following table:

#	Letter Grade	Grade points	Remarks

2	A	9	Excellent
3	B	8	Very good
4	C	7	Good
5	D	6	Fair
6	E	5	Satisfactory
7	F	0	Fail
8	I*	-	Incomplete
9	W*	-	Withdrawal
10	AP	-	Audit Pass
11	AF	-	Audit Fail
* ëWí and ëIí grades are transitional grades.
ëAPí and ëAFí grades: A student shall be awarded either an AP (Audit Pass) or an AF (Audit Fail) grade for an audit course. The AP grade shall be awarded if the student satisfies the attendance and performance criteria specified for the course by the concerned teacher. Otherwise, an AF grade shall be awarded.
ëWí grade: ëWí grade shall be awarded to a student who has withdrawn from a course. Further, the ëWí grade shall be recorded in the grade card. A student may withdraw from an audit course in which case there shall be no mention of the course in the grade card.
ëIí grade: An íIí grade shall be awarded temporarily to a student who is unable to appear for ESA for one or more courses, with the permission of the Vice-Chancellor in response to a written appeal by the student, due to valid reasons such as medical emergency and calamity in the family. For such a student, the ëIí grade shall be converted to one of the other letter grades (S to F) after the completion of scheduled make-up ESA. If the student does not appear for the make-up ESA, the ëIí grade shall be converted to ëFí grade.
 
Academic Policies and Regulations	PES University
ëFí grade: A student shall be awarded ëFí grade if he/she either fails in the course or is absent for the ESA of that course. If a course has theory and laboratory / practical components, the student shall appear for ESA in both of them. Absenting in any one or both of them shall result in the award of ëFí grade.
SGPA and CGPA
The overall performance of a student shall be indicated by two indices namely, Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).
The SGPA is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all courses registered by the student during a particular semester. The SGPA shall be calculated as:
SGPA = ? CiGi / ? Ci,
where Ciís, are the number of credits for the courses registered for the semester, and Giís are the corresponding grade points secured by the student.
The CGPA is an indication of an up-to-date overall performance of a student and the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the courses registered by the student since he/she is admitted to the University. It shall be calculated as:
CGPA = ? CiGi / ? Ci
The summations being carried out over the total number of courses registered by the student.
If a student obtains an ëFí grade in a course and registers for the same course in a subsequent semester, the new grade obtained shall replace the previous ëFí grade in calculating the CGPA.
If a student obtains an ëFí grade in an elective course and registers for the same or equivalent course in a subsequent semester, the new grade obtained shall replace the previous ëFí grade in calculating the CGPA.
Grades obtained in audit courses and transitional grades shall not be considered in the calculations of CGPA and SGPA.
Class / Division Declaration
The following classes of results shall be declared, for a student upon graduation, considering the below specified criteria:

CGPA	Equivalent Percentage	Class / Division
= 5.0 ñ < 5.75	-	Pass Class

= 6.75 ñ < 7.75	= 60 & < 70	First Class
= 7.75 ñ < 9.50	= 70 & < 87.5	First Class with Distinction
>9.50	= 87.5	First Class with Honors
First Class with Honors: A student completing a Program of Study within the specified minimum duration, securing a CGPA of 9.50 or above, passing all the courses of the program in the first appearance, and not obtaining any transitional grades shall be declared to have passed in First Class with Honors.
